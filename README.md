## In this brief analysis, I tried to explore the customer base of Citi Bike to help better understand their behavior.
## In doing so, I hope to accomplish two things:
### - Identify where more bikes should be installed
### - Create targeted marketing campaigns that will appeal to different customer segments



#### You are welcome to check out the PowerPoint that I made documenting the whole data analysis process.
#### There is a PDF version too, you are welcome :)




### This data analysis is done with the help of the short course I took at CAREERFOUNDRY (Data Analytics Short Course).
#### They provided me with the data. Check them out at the link below.
