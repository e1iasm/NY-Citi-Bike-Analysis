# NY Citi Bike Analysis


#### In this brief analysis, I tried to explore the customer base of Citi Bike to help better understand their behavior.
#### In doing so, I hope to accomplish two things:
##### - Identify where more bikes should be installed
##### - Create targeted marketing campaigns that will appeal to different customer segments



###### You are welcome to check out the PowerPoint that I made documenting the whole data analysis process.
###### It is in a PDF version too, you are welcome :)




###### This data analysis is done with the help of the short course I took at CAREERFOUNDRY (Data Analytics Short Course).
###### They provided me with the data. Check them out at the link below.
